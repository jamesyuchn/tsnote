note about setting certain priviledge on aws
--------------------------------------------

It is dangerous stopping production servers by mistake, or even terminating it, by accident. I read some aws documentation and find a way to prevent it.

0. Setup an AWS account, login into root priviledge and prepare certain user for test use.
Also, create a group called 'developer', for example.

1. Upright courner, 'Security Credentials' -> Left, 'Groups' -> get into 'developer'

2. Scroll down to 'Permissions', 'Attach Policy', find 'AmazonEC2FullAccess' and attach it

3. Create a policy in 'Inline Policies', -> 'Policy Generator', select:

Effect: 'Deny', AWS Service: 'Amazon EC2', Action: 'StopInstances' and 'TerminateInstances',

Then ARN: 'arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:*:instance/i-36bb32e0'
//the i-36bb32e0 is my EC2 Instance ID

*Rule of ARN: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html

Finally, review and save the policy, it works immediately. Any user in this group will be affected.

This can also be performed to a single user, by selecting 'Users' and the following steps are the same.
